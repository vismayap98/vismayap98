## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Vismaya!

A passionate **Data Enthusiast** with a strong foundation in data analytics, cloud, and automation. I'm driven by curiosity and the desire to turn raw data into actionable insights through smart pipelines and clean visualizations.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:  
  Building a **modern SQL-based Data Warehouse** project and integrating real-time analytics into my [portfolio](https://vismayap98.github.io).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  
  **Apache Spark**, **Apache Airflow**, and exploring advanced data engineering workflows.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:  
  Open-source projects involving **data pipelines**, **ETL automation**, or **AI-powered analytics dashboards**.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:  
  Designing scalable pipelines using **Spark + Airflow**, and deploying **end-to-end data apps**.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  
  SQL, Power BI, Looker Studio, Cloud Projects (AWS), or how I built my **sql data warehouse** from scratch!
